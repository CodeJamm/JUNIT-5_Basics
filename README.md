# JUNIT-5_Basics ‚ù§Ô∏è 

- This module consists of Some Important and Basic Concepts of JUNIT-5 (Unit Testing) which is verymuch supportive for testing our Code with multiple test scripts in Eclipse/Spring framework.

# Introduction üëã

- This JUnit 5 tutorial talks about how it adapted java 8 style of coding and several other features as well.
- JUnit 5 is most widely used testing framework for java applications. 
- For very long time, JUnit has been doing its job perfectly. 
- In between, JDK 8 brought very exciting features in java and most notably lambda expressions. 
- JUnit 5 aims to adapt java 8 style of coding and several other features as well, that‚Äôs why java 8 is required to create and execute tests in JUnit 5 (though it is possible to execute tests written with JUnit 3 or JUnit 4 for backward compatibility).

# JUnit 5 Architecture üì∫
  
     JUnit 5 = JUnit Platform + JUnit Jupiter + JUnit Vintage

## JUnit Platform

- To be able to launch junit tests, IDEs, build tools or plugins need to include and extend platform APIs. It defines the TestEngine API for developing new testing frameworks that runs on the platform.
- It also provides a Console Launcher to launch the platform from the command line and build plugins for Gradle and Maven.

## JUnit Jupiter

- It includes new programming and extension models for writing tests. 
- It has all new junit annotations and TestEngine implementation to run tests written with these annotations.

## JUnit Vintage

- It primary purpose is to support running JUnit 3 and JUnit 4 written tests on the JUnit 5 platform. 
- It‚Äôs there are backward compatibility.

# Installation üì´

You can use JUnit 5 in your maven or gradle project by including minimum two dependencies i.e. Jupiter Engine Dependency and Platform Runner Dependency.
